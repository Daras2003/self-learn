 The pandemic has also left it's scar on the Indian economy by leaving a major part of it's population unemployed.<br> During the lockdown , an estimated <b>"140 million"</b> people lost employment while salaries were cut off for many others.
  More than 45% of households across the nation have reported an income drop as compared to the previous year. 
  Stock markets in India reporeted their worst losses in history on 23 March 2020. The sudden disruption caused by Covid-19 has led to the fall of GDP by 3.1% according to the <b><i>Mininstry of Statistics.
